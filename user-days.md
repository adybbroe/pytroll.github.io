title: Pytroll User Days

![EUMETSAT](eumetsat.jpg)

As the Pytroll community has been growing, and some of the modules like
Satpy are used by a wider audience, it becomes more difficult for us
developers to be aware of all the usages and needs from the community.
At the same time, the plans the core developers have for Pytroll are not
widely discussed with the community.

Hence, the Pytroll core team feels it is high time to organise an event
to gather input and spread information regarding the project, and to
that end, we are organising the Pytroll User Days.

During these days, we would like to hear of user stories, how Pytroll is
used, to what end, and where the users struggle most. We thus encourage
everyone to present such stories during the event.
At the same time, the core developers of Pytroll will present some of
the latest news, ongoing projects and plans they have for the different
packages.
Examples of presentations some of us will have to show:

* Plans for the future of Satpy and Pyresample
* How to setup a full satellite imagery processing chain using
Trollmoves, Pytroll-Collectors and Trollflow2
* Running Pytroll processing in containers
* ...


In summary, it will be a couple of days to spread information, with the
goal to tighten the community, allowing the project to grow in the right
direction.
After these two days, the participating developers will continue working
together the rest of the week for as we usually do during a Pytroll
Contributor Week.

The event will take place on June 10th and 11th, 2024, at EUMETSAT, in
Darmstadt, Germany.
