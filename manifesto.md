## Pytroll adding value for satellite users

### Produce what users want (need!)

#### Unexpected needs

- User requests are unpredictable and development time potentially long. A flexible development and production system is needed in order to honor user requests in reasonable time when they are made.
- Own software development is needed in order to be able to create highly specialized products.

#### Users unaware of possibilities

- A gap exists between the domain users knowledge and the satellite developers knowledge of sensors technical capabilities. This leads to lack of knowledge of potential satellite data applications within a specific domain.
- A communication and analysis effort is needed in order to start briding the gap.
- The current (and for the foreseeable future) existence of the knowledge gap means the satellite software development needs to be planning ahead as users have limited capability to foresee the usage of future satellite data types.

#### Enable users to discover existing data

- Inability for users to efficiently discover data means resources are wasted when users use time retrieving data elsewhere
- Inability to efficiently query meta-data and geographical coverage means users waste time retrieving and filtering away unneeded datasets
- External systems creating meta-data based on actual file contents is processing intense leading to higher energy consumption

#### Integrate externally developed software gracefully

- Satellite data processing is dependent on third party software packages. These needs to be integrated in a consistent way in order to limit development effort.
- A consistent integration approach allows for sharing of package integrators between institutes saving duplicate development effort.

#### Interface for internally developed software

- A typically seen approach is for researchers to develop a full processing chain when creating a new product. As researchers are not trained software developers this typically leads to poor handling of the processing outside the scientific core of the processing chain as well as not integrating with existing production environments. A major rewrite of the software is normally needed in order to start production.
- This process does not add any value to the end user of the product. With the existence of a well defined interface for a scientific core the researchers can focus on creating modules adhering to this interface and the development efforts to bring such a module into production will be very limited.

### Rapid development response

#### Short article-to-production time

- The shortest possible time from product requirements definition to a final product in operations maximizes the value for end users as development response time decreases and more products can be put into production within a given time frame.
- A framework is needed for developing satellite data processing that will limit the amount of development resources spent on repetitive development.
- An easily configurable production environment will limit the amount of resources spent on configuration and maintenance.

#### Why Python?

The programming language Python has been chosen since it

- accomodates rapid development
- is widely used for scientific applications
- has good numerical performance
- is easy to use and understand for beginners
- is very flexible for experienced software programmers

#### Crisis handling

- Rapid prototyping and production integration allows for usage of satellite products in case of crisis (volcano eruptions and similar single upset events).

### Production system resilience

#### High reliability and timeliness

- Software development of high quality is needed due to requirements on data reliability and timeliness.
- Levering existing knowledge of developing suitable software

#### Inter institution backup of key data sources

- Backup of locally received data and derived products
- Full coverage of these kind of centrally produced products is unlikely to happen in a foreseeable future.

### Efficient resource usage

- Sharing of software components removes duplicate software development efforts
  - Satellite data processing is very similar at meteorological services. Using the same software platform eliminates duplicate software development for the same functionality.
  - The more partners involved in the development the greater the resource saving effect.
- Sharing of processing intense products reduces energy consumption and resource usage on configuration and maintenance
  - Not co-producing processing intense products (typically products derived from local reception not accessible from a central processing facility) at institutes saves processing resources and thereby energy.
  - Saving resources not configuring and maintaining all processing systems frees up resources for development.
- The choice of free and open source is deliberately taken to support efficient sharing of development resources and make the software easily accessible to users. Open source code projects stimulates collaboration, and more easily generates positive spin offs. Also, exposing the code to the open source community results in software of higher quality (high demands on stability, easy installation, good documentation, etc).

### Pytroll successes

- Framework created for satellite data processing (mpop et al.).
- VIIRS (S-NPP) ready before launch. Very limited effort to add level1 and upstream processing to the framework.
- mpop replacing comercial ill-fitting systems, adding flexibility, consistency and saving cost and processing resources.
- Trollcasting: Efficient, secure and flexible data exchange. Being set up among the National Met Services. Interests from Canada and EUMETSAT (EARS team) among others.
- Open Source approach extending usage and possible collaboration. Operational at Iceland, besides Denmark and Sweden. Being put in operation at FMI, Finland. The user base is global (Asia, USA, Canada, South America, Europe).
