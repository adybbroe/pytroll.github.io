title: History of Pytroll
---

The open source collaboration that became Pytroll started in 2009 by a handful
of developers at the Danish Met Service (DMI) and SMHI including current
maintainers Martin Raspaud and Adam Dybbroe. We realized that we had a lot in
common. We all liked Python and were solving or wanted to solve a lot of
similar problems. There was also a desire to get rid of ill-suited proprietary
software in our satellite data production systems. At some point around 2010
the effort had grown big enough that we felt it needed a name. The "troll" in
Pytroll hints at the Nordic/Scandinavian heritage. Soon after colleagues at
FMI (the Finnish Met Service) and the Icelandic Met Service joined. The name
was not liked equally by all of us, but it was the best we could come up with.

Now we are stuck with it. ðŸ˜€
